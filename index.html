					<p>Hi, my name is Dervin and I’m a web developer in the making. I like long walks by the lake and candle lit dinners. My hobbies include underwater basket weaving and camel racing. If you would like to see some of my work please feel free to visit the links provided in the “Connect with Me” section of this website. I hope to have more projets to share within the next few months so make sure to revisit for updates. You are also welcome to send me a message via the “Contact” page if you have any specific questions or comments you would like to share.</p>
